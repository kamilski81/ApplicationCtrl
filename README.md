ApplicationCtrl
========

  Application-[Ctrl] provides a badly needed open source solution for managing downloaded applications. Simply put Application-[Ctrl] allows operations teams to turn off old versions of apps and force or encourage users to update to the latest version. This prevents:
  Unpredictable behavior when functional changes to ReST APIs roll out
  Users from encountering serious defects and security issues on out of date versions
  Defects in application versions from harming servers
  Every application that connects to the internet on iOS and Android needs lifecycle control and Apple and Google don't provide it.
