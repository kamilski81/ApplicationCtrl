OpsCheck
========

The OpsCheck is a set of tool that tracks application release. Users are able to set which
 particular application version is still able to run with their current system.
The tool has two components:
- Server: automatically collects information about new app versions
- Client Library: provides information to the server, e.g. version and build of the app.
